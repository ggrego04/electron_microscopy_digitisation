## General info
A system that can be used to measure the thickness of a membrane.

## Technologies
Technologies and Frameworks used for this project:
* Python 3.7
* Qt Designer
* Conda environments
* PyCharm
* Tensorflow

## Demonstration
There is a video inside the repository that explains and shows how the system works

## Structure
There are two editions of the same program, one that makes use of the Unet neural network to find the area of the membrane (final.py) and another one where this process can be done manually by the user (final_v2.py).
